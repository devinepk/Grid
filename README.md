# Notes

We have several small, pesky css issues.

1. When you click on a tab, the tab is highlighted until you click somewhere else
on the page. This looks weird. Can we not do this?

2. On the list, can we truncate or wrap the URL when the page width is small?

3. Ideally, for both list and grid view, we should have uniformly-sized images.
